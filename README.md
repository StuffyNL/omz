omz
Audio conversion tool for konsole
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'omz' version: 1.3.1
Copyright (c) 2018

For usage type: 'omz -h' in your konsole.
This tool works only with a linux konsole!

It does not matter what distro you are using, just make sure you have installed following tools/programs:
'flac', 'mac' (monkeys Audio Codec), 'oggdec', 'mpg123', 'mplayer', 'lame' (ofcourse do not forget this one!)

All programs should be availlable on pretty much all distro's. So there is no reason why it should not work
on the distro you are using.
